# 🏥 Australian Hospital Performance Analysis (SQL Project)

This project explores public hospital performance across Australia using data from the AIHW MyHospitals API. It demonstrates real-world data ingestion, normalization, and complex SQL-based analysis to derive healthcare insights.

## 🚀 Objective

To analyze key hospital performance metrics — such as emergency admissions, surgery wait times, and hospital workloads — across different Australian states and hospital networks.

## 🛠️ Stack

- SQL Server / PostgreSQL (your choice)
- Python (for optional data extraction from API)
- Public dataset: AIHW MyHospitals API
